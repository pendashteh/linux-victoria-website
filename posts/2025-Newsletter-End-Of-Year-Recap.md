## Coming up in 2026
Author: Sophie 

One of the most common feedback we got in 2025 was announcing events too close to the event date.   
For the coming year, we have planned on an events structure that gives enough variety of events and allows us to give without putting too much burden on volunteer work.  

<div class="alert alert-primary">
Subscribe to the <a href="https://lu.ma/linux-victoria" target="_blank">Linux Victoria calendar</a> and <a href="https://lu.ma/electron-workshop" target="_blank">Electron Workshop calendar</a> on Luma so you can see and get notified of new events! 
</div>


### Key Dates
While most of the dates for events are still being figured out, the below are already planned, so mark them on your calendar! 

**22nd January**   
LUV Breakfast at Everything Open

**31st January**   
LUV BBQ

**25th March**   
Document Freedom Day

**18th April**   
Hardware Freedom Day

**25th August**   
Linux Regional Summit Ballarat

**19th September**   
Software Freedom Day

### Repeating events
For 2026, each month will have a different topic
We will also run some events on a Quarterly basis (one every 3 months), giving enough preparation time for everyone.

#### Monthly Discussion and Town Hall

#### Collab
In 2025, we found that most LUG's around Australia want to have in person events but it takes a lot to organise.   

Every Quarter, we plan to run a meetup with another LUG in Australia.



#### Regional
In 2025, we found that most LUG's around Australia want to have in person events but it takes a lot to organise.   



#### Technical Talk in Melbourne
Intially, we wanted to have monthly technical talks, however, seeing the challange of finding a speaker every month, we have decided to aim for a quarterly talk in Melbourne.
