# LAIT Night Linux & AI Tuesday Chats: SEASON 1
Author: Sophie

In July 2025, we started running weekly discussions on the intersection Linux and AI titled "LAIT Night: Linux & AI Tuesday Chats".   
Great conversations were had every week, with participants discovering new AI tools and LLM's that focused that were open source and/or open weight.  


This series ran consistently from July to the end of September and delivered an event in partnership with MLAI Melbourne group in August.  

We are  hoping to incorporate all the learnings for re-launching this initiative in the coming year.

So far we are discussing having Linux and AI workshops, events with a topic, pre-planned talks and much more ideas are brewing.    
If you would like to be a part of organising, running a LAIT Night, or want to submit an event topic, [reach out to the team](https://linuxvictoria.org/engage/)!
